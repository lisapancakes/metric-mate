        <div class="welcome-card">
          <h3>1) Kickoff – Set goals &amp; context</h3>
          <p>Capture the project summary, business &amp; product goals, user goals, and key pain points. This becomes the backbone of the dashboard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="welcome-card">
          <h3>2) Midterm – Check health &amp; momentum</h3>
          <p>Update goal status, add risks, wins, learnings, and next steps. MetricMate updates the dashboard so everyone sees where things really stand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="welcome-card">
          <h3>3) Final – Summarize outcomes</h3>
          <p>Log final results, decisions, and what shipped. The final dashboard rolls everything up and can prefill a case-study form for you.</p>
